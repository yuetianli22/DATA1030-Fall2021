    "- **When we want to find hyper parameters, we use embedded loops to go through it, but the problem I have is that how that related to cross-validation methods, since right now, we have a concrete training set and validation sets in order to get a good hyper parameters. From my personal knowledge, cross-validation method would change training set a few times, so I confused about what is the connections between them**\n",
    "    - what you refer to is called k-fold cross validation\n",
    "    - that's just one way to do CV\n",
    "    - we will cover a handful of techniques to do CV/tune hyperparameters\n",
    "- **In quiz 3, the option \"Underfitting means that the model performs similarly on the training and validation sets\", why is it incorrect? In the example you have shown in class, underfitting means that models perform poorly on both the training and validation sets.**\n",
    "- **for the quiz 3, underfit means they both perform poorly, why they can't be said be similar?**\n",
    "    -  the best model can perform similarly on the training and validation sets, and that model performance is not poor, it's optimal\n",
    "    - you need to see the whole training and validation curves as a function of the hyperparameter to decide when the model performance is poor\n",
    "- **For a certain model, such as gradient descent model, I usually change the step size manually, how can I choose the step size in a \"smarter\" way?**\n",
    "    - gradient descent is a numerical algorithm used to find a local or global minimum of a function\n",
    "    - it is used in ML algorithms to find optimal model parameters\n",
    "    - but it is not a ML model\n",
    "- **Are there any resources we can use to practice the things we're learning in class that aren't graded? So like some practice exercises?**\n",
    "    - kaggle.com\n",
    "    - check out and participate in ML comeptitions\n",
    "- **Just the last contour plot - I am interested in knowing more about how the background was colored**\n",
    "- **I'm not familiar with some package/function we use in python**\n",
    "    - I unfortunately don't have time to go through the code line by line during class so I highly recommend that you study the code outside of class\n",
    "    - print out the variables\n",
    "    - read the manuals of the functions\n",
    "    - change things in the code\n",
    "- **Where and how \"Cs = np.logspace(-1,3,13)\" is developed is the muddiest for me.**\n",
    "    - check out help(np.logspace)\n",
    "    - it's a numpy function that generates uniformly spaced numbers in log space\n",
    "    - I'll show you the pythonian tricks I came across and found useful\n",
    "    - you'll find your own tricks and favorite functions\n",
    "- **Going forward, will the mathematical definitions for some of these ideas be provided? I'm probably in the minority for preferrring this, but I think that it helps to see those definitions, even if they aren't talked about. For example \"A dataset is structured if all elements can be minimally embedded in R^d for the same d\" or \"A dataset is unstructured if the minimal embedding for elements vary\"**\n",
    "    - not so much in this class\n",
    "    - we will focus on practical issues rather than rigorous mathematical formulation\n",

    "## The steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: you need to understand your data and verify that it doesn't contain errors\n",
    "   - do as much EDA as you can!\n",
    "    \n",
    "**2. Split the data into different sets**: most often the sets are train, validation, and test (or holdout)\n",
    "   - practitioners often make errors in this step!\n",
    "   - you can split the data randomly, based on groups, based on time, or any other non-standard way if necessary to answer your ML question\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Preprocess the data**: ML models only work if X and Y are numbers! Some ML models additionally require each feature to have 0 mean and 1 standard deviation (standardized features)\n",
    "   - often the original features you get contain strings (for example a gender feature would contain 'male', 'female', 'non-binary', 'unknown') which needs to transformed into numbers\n",
    "   - often the features are not standardized (e.g., age is between 0 and 100) but it needs to be standardized\n",
    "    \n",
    "**4. Choose an evaluation metric**: depends on the priorities of the stakeholders\n",
    "   - often requires quite a bit of thinking and ethical considerations\n",
    "     \n",
    "**5. Choose one or more ML techniques**: it is highly recommended that you try multiple models\n",
    "   - start with simple models like linear or logistic regression\n",
    "   - try also more complex models like nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forest, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**6. Tune the hyperparameters of your ML models (aka cross-validation)**\n",
    "   - ML techniques have hyperparameters that you need to optimize to achieve best performance\n",
    "   - for each ML model, decide which parameters to tune and what values to try\n",
    "   - loop through each parameter combination\n",
    "       - train one model for each parameter combination\n",
    "       - evaluate how well the model performs on the validation set\n",
    "   - take the parameter combo that gives the best validation score\n",
    "   - evaluate that model on the test set to report how well the model is expected to perform on previously unseen data\n",
    "    \n",
    "**7. Interpret your model**: black boxes are often not useful\n",
    "   - check if your model uses features that make sense (excellent tool for debugging)\n",
    "   - often model predictions are not enough, you need to be able to explain how the model arrived to a particular prediction (e.g., in health care)"
